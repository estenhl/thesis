\chapter*{Abstract}
\textcolor{red}{Due to advancements in DNA sequencing technologies the amount of genetic data has exploded over the last decade. Traditional models for representing said data can not account for the observed variation and more advanced representations are necessary to accurately depict the true nature of genetical information. However, more complex models calls for more complex techniques for interacting with the data. In this thesis we present an efficient, non-heuristical approach for finding optimal alignments of genetic sequences against graph-based reference genomes. MORE}
