\chapter{Introduction}
With the initial sequencing of the human genome in 2001 \cite{human_genome}, the blueprint of our species was digitalized and made publicly available. Researches utilize this information to understand the cause of genetic diseases and disorders, and have made great progress in developing of more accurate diagnoses and treatment. In order to understand the data, bioinformaticians have developed tools and methods for analysis. These techniques are typically string algorithms developed to handle traditional linear genetic \hl{sequences}. As sequencing technology progresses, the cost of sequencing sees a proportionate decrease\textcolor{red}{[ref]}. This will in turn lead to a larger number of individuals being sequenced to form a larger base of genetic information. Because DNA is prone to mutations, the sequencing data is bound to contain variation. The amount of variation present in a database is directly impacted by the number of sequenced individuals and will therefore grow at a rate correlated to the progression in the sequencing technologies.\\
\par\noindent
In order to account for the variation, more complex standards for modeling genetic data is being proposed. One possibility for such a model revolves around graph based representations for reference genomes \textcolor{red}{MÃ… NEVNES TIDLIGERE}\textcolor{red}{[ref]}. \hlcyan{A graph is a data structure which has the innate property of modelling relationships which are more complex than what can be represented by a linear model. This is an appealing trait, but not at the cost of functionality which exists in the current models.} Deciding the feasibility of adapting existing methods is crucial in order to determine \hlcyan{the validity of the model.}\\
\par\noindent
\hlcyan{One of the most important operations in genetic analysis is sequence alignment, a solution to a problem which revolves around finding similarities between text strings.} The problem has for some time been considered solved when the input data is regular strings\textcolor{red}{[ref]}. We will in this thesis present our translation of the alignment problem to the realm of graphs and present an approach for solving this variant of the problem.
