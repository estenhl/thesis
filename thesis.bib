doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btu756}, 
abstract ={Motivation: Genomics is expanding from a single reference per species paradigm into a more comprehensive pan-genome approach that analyzes multiple individuals together. A compressed de Bruijn graph is a sophisticated data structure for representing the genomes of entire populations. It robustly encodes shared segments, simple SNPs, and complex structural variations far beyond what can be represented in a collection of linear sequences alone.Results: We explore deep topological relationships between suffix trees and compressed de Bruijn graphs and introduce an algorithm, splitMEM, that directly constructs the compressed de Bruijn graph in time and space linear to the total number of genomes for a given maximum genome size. We introduce suffix skips to traverse several suffix links simultaneously, and use them to efficiently decompose maximal exact matches (MEMs) into graph nodes. We demonstrate the utility of splitMEM by analyzing the 9-strain pan-genome of Bacillus anthracis and up to 62 strains of Escherichia coli, revealing their core-genome properties.Availability: Source code and documentation available open-source http://splitmem.sourceforge.netContact: mschatz@cshl.edu},

abstract ={Motivation: Progressive Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) methods
  depend on reducing an MSA to a linear profile for each alignment
  step. However, this leads to loss of information needed for accurate
  alignment, and gap scoring artifacts.Results: We present a graph representation of an MSA that can
  itself be aligned directly by pairwise dynamic programming,
  eliminating the need to reduce the MSA to a profile. This enables
  our algorithm (Partial Order Alignment (POA)) to guarantee that the
  optimal alignment of each new sequence versus each sequence in the
  MSA will be considered. Moreover, this algorithm introduces a new
  edit operator, homologous recombination, important for multidomain
  sequences. The algorithm has improved speed (linear time complexity)
  over existing MSA algorithms, enabling construction of massive and
  complex alignments (e.g. an alignment of 5000 sequences in 4 h on a
  Pentium II). We demonstrate the utility of this algorithm on a
  family of multidomain SH2 proteins, and on EST assemblies containing
  alternative splicing and polymorphism.Availability: The partial order alignment program POA is

The pace of change in this area is rapid with three major new sequencing platforms having been released in 2011: Ion Torrent's PGM, Pacific Biosciences' RS and the Illumina MiSeq. Here we compare the results obtained with those platforms to the performance of the Illumina HiSeq, the current market leader. In order to compare these platforms, and get sufficient coverage depth to allow meaningful analysis, we have sequenced a set of 4 microbial genomes with mean GC content ranging from 19.3 to 67.7\%. Together, these represent a comprehensive range of genome content. Here we report our analysis of that sequence data in terms of coverage distribution, bias, GC distribution, variant detection and accuracy.",

As a result, error correction of sequencing reads remains an important problem. Though several tools do an excellent job of correcting datasets where the reads are sampled close to uniformly, the problem of correcting reads coming from drastically non-uniform datasets, such as those from single-cell sequencing, remains open.Results: In this article, we develop the method Hammer for error correction without any uniformity assumptions. Hammer is based on a combination of a Hamming graph and a simple probabilistic model for sequencing errors. It is a simple and adaptable algorithm that improves on other tools on non-uniform single-cell data, while achieving comparable results on normal multi-cell data.Availability: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pashadag.Contact: pmedvedev@cs.ucsd.edu},

doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btu440}, 
abstract ={Motivation: Automatic error correction of high-throughput sequencing data can have a dramatic impact on the amount of usable base pairs and their quality. It has been shown that the performance of tasks such as de novo genome assembly and SNP calling can be dramatically improved after read error correction. While a large number of methods specialized for correcting substitution errors as found in Illumina data exist, few methods for the correction of indel errors, common to technologies like 454 or Ion Torrent, have been proposed.Results: We present Fiona, a new stand-alone read errorâcorrection method. Fiona provides a new statistical approach for sequencing error detection and optimal error correction and estimates its parameters automatically. Fiona is able to correct substitution, insertion and deletion errors and can be applied to any sequencing technology. It uses an efficient implementation of the partial suffix array to detect read overlaps with different seed lengths in parallel. We tested Fiona on several real datasets from a variety of organisms with different read lengths and compared its performance with state-of-the-art methods. Fiona shows a constantly higher correction accuracy over a broad range of datasets from 454 and Ion Torrent sequencers, without compromise in speed.Conclusion: Fiona is an accurate parameter-free read errorâcorrection method that can be run on inexpensive hardware and can make use of multicore parallelization whenever available. Fiona was implemented using the SeqAn library for sequence analysis and is publicly available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/fiona.Contact: mschulz@mmci.uni-saarland.de or hugues.richard@upmc.frSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
