\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I want to thank my supervisors Lex Nederbragt and Geir Kjetil Sandve for involving me in an interesting project and for providing guidance throughout the entire process. I also want to extend a special thanks to PhD candidate Ivar Grytten for proposing interesting views, good discussions and helpful tips and tricks along the way. I would like to commend the other master students in the Biomedical Informatics group on their contributions towards creating an exiciting learning environment. Lastly, I want to thank my friends and family for providing moral support and encouragement whenever needed over the last few months.
